Replicated a Maximum Entropy Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning model for Human Social Navigation,
demonstrating accuracy within 2 meters of the original in TensorFlow with < 25% of the computational power. Conducted extensive ablation studies, enhancing the understanding of model dynamics, and providing an open-source state-of-the-art model for future machine learning research
